    <p>At the end of the 70s, with the end of the band Sex Pistol (extremely important for punk, as a movement and musical genre), artists also influenced by punk, wanted to enter the music scene in an innovative way in England. Several bands emerged during this period, all of which shared similarities in their music, not only due to the influence of punk rock, but also due to the themes present in the groups' lyrics and aesthetics. Therefore, bands such as Bauhaus, Joy Division and Siouxsie and the Banshees emerged, which are considered pioneers of post-punk and gothic rock. In Brazil, in that same period, they called gothic “dark”. The influences, such as sources from which these bands and many others drew, shared several gothic aspects, so their audience could be the same. In addition to punk/post-punk as a musical influence, we will talk about 5 bands from the scene and their directly musical inspirations, or about the themes. It is worth mentioning Sisters of the Mercy and The Cure(they were not considered gothic, but the sound was important for the subculture and also influenced musical artists). Three important bands for what would be gothic rock:</p>

        <p>Bauhaus</p>
        <p>The English group was formed in Northampton in 1978. Later, Peter Murphy (vocals) reunited with Daniel Ash (vocals, guitar), David Jay (bass, vocals) and Kevin Haskin (drums). Before becoming Bauhaus, the trio was called Craze. The new name was inspired by the German school of architecture, from where the logo of the band Considerados (one of the) fathers of gothic rock also came from. After six weeks of formation, the group recorded (on an independent label) the demo “Bela Lugosi's Dead” which was one of the precursors of gothic. With a song about the iconic Dracula interpreter, lurid vocals, serious sound and the feeling of suspense, the word gothic was soon used to categorize it. Despite lasting 10 minutes, the song made it to BBC Radio. They then signed with 4AD, and in 1980 they released their first album (in addition to singles). In The Flat Field reached number one on the alternative charts, becoming successful. And so one of the most iconic bands on the scene was consolidated.</p>

        <p>Joy Division</p>
        <p>The band formed after a Sex Pistol concert. School friends Peter Hook and Bernard Sumner (guitarist) were joined by Terry Manson (drummer, while they were called Warsaw), but later Stephen Morris was the de facto drummer for Joy Division. They met Ian Curtis (vocals), who was also at this show with his wife, in Manchester. The name that continued until the end, came from the novel “A Doll's House” written by a survivor of the Second World War, referred to the group of Jewish women who were victims of abuse. They never explained the lyrics to the songs. Ian said that the lyrics are open to interpretation, they are multidimensional and that each person should read it however they want. The iconic Unknown Pleasures album cover came from a science textbook depicting radio waves from Pulsar CP 1919, which represents the remnants of a star that became a pulsar, a smaller star. Several methods were used to record the songs, and in all songs, there was only one chance for recording. Ian suffered from depression and epilepsy, at the age of 23 he committed suicide. This occurred 2 days before leaving on their first tour, which would be a milestone for the band. His illness was getting worse and he could suffer attacks during shows, making him feel unwell. They believe this condition worsened their depression. With Ian's death, the band made a promise not to end the partnership, and created New Order. The album Closer was a posthumous release. They had greatly impacted several bands that followed.</p>

        <p>Siouxsie and The Banshees</p>
        <p>The group was still called Suzie and The Banshees when they performed for the first time in 1976, their first concert, at the Punk Festival. Sid Vicious (future member of the Sex Pistols) on drums, Marco Pirroni on guitar, Steve Severin on bass and Siouxsie Sioux on vocals. And in 1978 they signed a contract with the publisher Polydor and a month later, they released their first single “Hong Kong Garden” which was very well received. Then his first album “The Scream”, which followed his first tour outside England. Budgie joined the band and, provisionally, Robert Smith, vocalist and guitarist for The Cure (who performed the first part of Siouxsie and The Banshees' shows). McGeoch became a permanent member, their sound was a basis for what would become the psychedelic and goth of the 80s. Kiss in the Dreamhouse preceded the departure of McGeoch, who was replaced by Robert Smith, in theory permanently(later left the Banshees to focus on The Cure). The band returned with “Dear Prudence”, a cover of the Beatles song, and it was possibly their biggest hit in the United Kingdom. They even impacted the North American market with their success. In 96, Siouxsie and The Banshees ended their activities, and focused on other projects they had. It is worth mentioning that the band went through several changes, from the first year in operation, until shortly before they ended.</p>

    <p>In addition to gothic rock, there are many other genres of goth music, but here we’re gonna talk about Darkwave (or Dark Wave) is a musical genre that emerged with influences from new wave, gothic rock and electronic music. Perhaps, it is possible to say that it was between Post-punk, gothic rock and new wave, presented even in the bands above, but it was not a realized genre yet (but it would become, and soon became a musical genre. Characteristics of the songs are a dark new wave atmosphere (that's how it got its name). It started to be used for many new wave bands or songs that were more alternative or “heavy”. Also for gothic, which wasn't so rock and in some cases for Gothic in general. Another use was in the early 90s, to refer to German electronic bands (which later went into other classifications). Here are three darkwave artists for you to know:</p>
