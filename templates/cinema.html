        <p>As explained in the Literature part, gothic cinema came with everything in the 20th century. Political, cultural and social contexts are very reflected in cinema. And a great influence on Gothic in this art was German Expressionism, which emerged after the First World War and portrays feelings of defeat, misery and revolt against the war. It also addresses the states of the characters’ “souls”, in fact, of sick minds, with “crazy” and “crazy” characters. In this it introduces a fantasy scenario and a voluntary distortion of reality, a type of escapism. The influences of literature came precisely from the horror, suspense and horror genres (with its influences coming from Dracula, Frankenstein). Examples of early films are Nosferatu, “Sleepy Hollow” and “Psycho”.</p>
        <p>There is great diversity in the way subculture is portrayed or approached in films. They range from truly gothic films (in the sense of being compatible with literature, having a gothic setting and a narrative that can be classified as such) and there is also the portrayal of “gothic” characters, who are often stereotyped and perhaps even satirized. There is always a difficulty in combining aesthetics with the attitudes of goths, perhaps the reason is precisely because the subculture is not based on aesthetics, but on gothic music(and everything that influenced it, hence the influences of other arts and political movement). Thus, it remains to appreciate what is good about cinema considered “Gothic” since there are so many works referenced, but remember not to fall into stereotyping and let yourself be fooled.</p>
        <p>Cinema, even more so today, is a great opinion maker, influencing new fashion, market and consumption trends. In this sense, cinema obviously influenced the formation of opinions about the subculture, spreading an image of goths. Films that are very based on appearance and that do little to address the ideas or depth of the subculture, result precisely in selling a “cool”, “different”, “rebellious” image, but without motivations behind it and resulting in individualism. It is worth mentioning that, just as there are aspects of the community (which are usually related to aesthetics and the artistic content they consume, what their focus is…), in cinema there are also representations of more than one type of “gothic”. It is worth highlighting the wealth of gothic films linked to vampires, perhaps due to the influence of Dracula and Nosferatu, but also due to the melancholic and nocturnal settings (a good number of goths do activities related to enjoying the subculture in the evening or at night).</p>
        <p>In the film Interview with the Vampire, there is an environment based on the contrast of the modern with the ancient. Recalling gothic literature in the 19th century, where the modernity of an “urban” city was contrasted with an ancient being (or a mystery), which in this case, is the life story (in a way, of eternal death) of the vampire who is interviewed. Deep themes such as connections and interpersonal connections are addressed, as well as grief and the feeling of “regret”. The film is very “dark”, full of drama, suspense and some mysteries. It is an adaptation of the first book in Anne Rice's trilogy, the third book was also adapted and is another well-known gothic film, "Queen of the Damned".</p>
        <p>The 2004 Phantom of the Opera is a musical film, also gothic. An adaptation of the work by Gaston Leroux, from 1909 and classified as gothic fiction. Set in an opera house, the film is full of romanticism, mystery and suspense. As in many Gothic works, the deformation of bodies is also addressed. It is just one of several adaptations of the book, which featured musical plays and other films as representation.</p>
        <p>Sleepy Hollow, another adaptation! This time, by Washington Irving, from 1820, it is a short story, classified as horror and gothic fiction as well. Being one of Tim Burton's works, the film carries a dark aura of mystery and suspense about deaths that may have been caused by a supernatural being</p>
